## Planning & Development Process:
* Creation of user stories and acceptance criteria for admins and regular users.
* Initially started with data structure by creating an ERD and the corresponding java model classes.
* Distribution of feature list among project members.
* Create repository and service classes for each entity class.
* Create API endpoints for each service and CRUD operations.
* Perform endpoint testing to test that all APIs are functioning properly.
* Integrate all components and develop a frontend for the user to interact with.

## Challenges:
* Attempting to reference the user that is currently logged in by retrieving the user from the bearer token.
* Testing the endpoints to cover most of the validations and reduce the risk of exceptions.

## Favorite Functions:
* Swagger documentation
    * Addition of a name and description for each controller and each endpoint.
    * Produce a clear list of all endpoints, the request parameters and bodies they accept, and what is the expected return value.
* Email verification
    * Construct various email messages with HTML elements.
    * Connecting to the gmail servers to handle email sending.

## Run Instructions:
* Run the script.sql file in the Database folder.
* Modify variables in the application.properties and any other profiles.
* Run the sprinboot project.
* Access the endpoints names and description using swagger.
* Use postman to send requests to the API endpoints.
